# Creating a Character
Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition has greatly simplified the character creation process from past editions. As such, it is easier than ever to roll up a new character in a matter of minutes! This guide will cover the basics of how to build a character using a sample character as an example. It will begin with a concept, and that concept will be transformed into a fully playable level one character.  

**NOTE:** The _only_ things you need to play Dungeons and Dragons are a pencil, some paper, and one set of polyhedral dice. There are many other things that players may like to use, to make the game more for them and their characters, but none of them are required to play, nor are they required for a good time. For convenience, there is a [character sheet](./5eCharacterSheetPrintVersion.pdf) attached to this repository.  
> The example character built here will appear in sections that look like this.

**A Note on Dice**  
There are 7 polyhedral dice in a given set. They contain: 1 four-sided die, 1 six-sided die, 1 eight-sided, 2 ten-sided dice, 1 twelve-sided die, and twenty-sided die. From this point on, this reference will be using shorthand. When told to roll a number of dice it will look something like this: **2d10**. The first number is the number of dice to be rolled, the second number is the number of the sides the dice should have. **2d10** means roll two ten-sided dice. **4d6** means roll 4 six-sided dice.

#### So, grab some snacks, sharpen your pencil, and get your dice ready; get ready to build your character!

## 1. Concept
Come up with a concept. This sounds simple, but Dungeons and Dragons is a roleplaying game. You aren't usually just kicking in doors to kill monsters (although that _can_ be fun); you are a person with flaws and boons and quirks. This is meant to be a starting place. Come up with a name. Do you want your character to be loud and boisterous, or perhaps they should be quiet and contemplative. Do they care about other people, or do they only think about themselves and whatever makes them the most money.  

**NOTE:** Some people enjoy playing characters with qualities that are less familiar to them. Challenge yourself with something a bit outside of your comfort zone, but make sure that you take other peoples' experiences into account and that everyone is comfortable at the gaming table.
> Meera has always hated when people underestimate her. She may be short but she fights with the ferocity of 100 well trained soldiers. In her spare time, she likes to help people out with their problems. She has temper issues, especially when anyone questions their capabilities or strength.

## 2. Assign Ability Scores
Every character has a number of attributes that determine their physical and mental capabilities. There are six such attributes: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha).
* **Strength** determines the physical prowess of your character. How much can you lift or carry? Can you kick down that door? Can you carry all of that gold out of the dungeon?
* **Dexterity** determines you ability to be nimble, fast and coordinated. Can you balance on the rickety bridge over lava? Can you hit a moving target with a rock? can you slide under the closing portcullis without being hurt?
* **Constitution** determines how hardy you are. Can you eat something poisonous and survive? Can you sprint up the mountain path without suffering from exhaustion? Can you survive being attacked by that dragon?
* **Intelligence** determines you aptitude for logic and memory. Can you remember the obscure lore about the evil magical artifact? Can you figure out which key is meant for the magical lock? Can you search for the hidden trap in a methodical way?
* **Wisdom** determines your attention and attunement to the world around you. Can you tell if that shopkeeper is lying? Do you see the hidden goblins waiting to ambush you on the road? Can you convince the terrified horse to calm down?
* **Charisma** determines your presence and force of personality. Can you intimidate the guards into leaving alone? Can you convince the shopkeeper to give you a discount on those potions? And exactly how energetic was your performance at the local inn?

To determine your ability scores, you need a set of 6 numbers. The simplest way to generate these is to use what the rules call the **"Standard Array:"** 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8; however, the most popular way to generate ability scores is to roll for them.

1. Roll 4d6.
1. Drop the lowest of the 4 dice.
1. Add up the remaining 3 dice and write the number down.
1. Repeat steps 1 - 4 until you have 6 number written down.

Once you have six scores, place them as you wish among your different abilities. Every class has key abilities that determine how effective their features are. Place your highest scores in those abilities.  

**A Note on Low Scores:** Sometimes you have low ability scores. Embrace it! having flaws baked into your character can be lots of fun. It adds to the randomness at the gaming table and often leads to the most memorable moments in a game.
> Meera's player rolled for ability scores and got 17, 14, 14, 12, 9, and 6. Meera is very strong and hardy so she'll put a 17 in Strength and a 14 in Constitution. She pretty coordinated in a tense moment so she'll put another 14 in Dexterity. She grew up around intelligent people who were able to coach and tutor her, despite her modest upbringing so she'll put a 12 in intelligence. She may not be the best at sweet talking people but she has a strong presence so she'll put a 9 in Charisma. Lastly, Meera tends to be impulsive and often acts without thinking or observing the situation. She'll put her  in wisdom.

## 3. Pick a Race
There are a number of different races in Dungeons and Dragons. This determines things like your general appearance, heritage, age, height, and more. Each race comes with a few ability score bonuses, languages and other features. Some races even have a sub-race which determines even more features and abilities. For a full list of features that your race gets visit the link in the following table.

Race | Ability Score Increases | Has Sub-Race
---- | ----------------------- | -----------
[Human](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/human/) | +1 to all ability scores | No
[Dwarf](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/dwarf/) | +2 Con | Yes
[Elf](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/elf/) | +2 Dex | Yes
[Halfling](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/halfling/) | +2 Dex | Yes
[Gnome](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/gnome/) | +2 Int | Yes
[Half-Elf](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/half-elf/) | +2 Charisma, +1 to two others | No
[Dragonborn](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/dragonborn/) | +2 Str, +1 Cha | No
[Half-Orc](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/half-orc/) | +2 Str, +1 Con | No
[Tiefling](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/tiefling/) | +2 Cha, +1 Int | No

> Meera wants to play a small character so she'll play a Halfling (Sub-race: lightfoot). This allows her to increase her Dexterity Score by two and her charisma by 1. Additionally, she gets a number of other features as determined by the Halfling link above.

## 4. Pick a Class
The next step is pick your class. Your class determines most of your characters capabilities in _and_ out of combat. There are 12 classes in the game each with a different flavor, complexity and play-style. Your class determines whether or not you can cast spells, wear armor, use lock-picks and how many hit points you get at each level.

Class   | Key Abilities | Description | Hit Die
------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ------
[Barbarian](https://5thsrd.org/character/classes/barbarian/) | Str, Con | A ferocious warrior with a primal rage | 1d12

[Ranger](https://5thsrd.org/character/classes/ranger/) | Dex, Wis | A warrior who knows as much about the land as they do the monsters they hunt | 1d10
[Rogue](https://5thsrd.org/character/classes/rogue/) | Dex | A Sneaky and talented master of all skills who prefers to strike from the shadows | 1d8
[Sorcerer](https://5thsrd.org/character/classes/sorcerer/) | Cha | A mage blessed with magical power flowing through their veins from birth | 1d6
[Warlock](https://5thsrd.org/character/classes/warlock/) | Cha | A mage who made a binding pact with a supernatural being for power | 1d8
[Wizard](https://5thsrd.org/character/classes/wizard/) | Int | A mage who studied the intricacies of magic to learn spell-casting | 1d6

> Meera is a ferocious and wild fighter so she'll pick Barbarian as her class. She'll write down her features at level one on her character sheet.

### 5 Modifiers
The most important part of your character sheet is going to be your ability modifiers. These determine what you add to die rolls for ability checks, attacks and saving throws. Use the following table to determine your ability modifiers _after_ applying your racial bonuses.

Score   | Modifiers
------- | ---------
2 - 3   | -4
4 - 5   | -3
6 - 7   | -2
8 - 9   | -1
10 - 11 | 0
12 - 13 | +1
14 - 15 | +2
16 - 17 | +3
18 - 19 | +4
20 - 21 | +5

> Meera has a 17 in Strength, a 16 in Dexterity, a 14 in Constitution, a 12 in Constitution, a 6 in Wisdom and a 10 in Charisma. Her ability modifiers are +3, +3, +2, +1, -2, and 0 respectively.

### 6. Skills and Saves
At first level, you get to pick a number of skills from a list that appears at the top of your class's rules page. Whenever you roll an ability check for those skills, you can add an additional 2 to the number rolled on the die, in addition to the relevant ability modifier. Additionally, you get proficiency in two saving throws. Whenever you have to make one of those saving throws, you get to add 2 to the number rolled on the die in addition to the appropriate modifier.

Skills | Ability
------ | -------
Acrobatics | Dexterity
Animal Handling | Wisdom
Arcana | Intelligence
Athletics | Strength
Deception | Charisma
History | Intelligence
Insight | Wisdom
Intimidation | Charisma
Investigation | Intelligence
Medicine | Wisdom
Nature | Intelligence
Perception | Wisdom
Performance | Charisma
Persuasion | Charisma
Religion | Intelligence

Stealth | Dexterity
Survival | Wisdom

> As a Barbarian, Meera gets to choose two skills from her class list. She will choose Athletics and Intimidation as she is very good at sprinting and jumping as well as scaring people with her ferocity.

## 7. Hit Points
Hit points determine your character's ability to take physical punishment before falling unconscious or dying. At first level, your hit points are determined by the maximum number on your class's **hit die** (see above) plus your Constitution modifier.

> As a Barbarian, Meera has a d12 hit die, and with a Constitution score of 14, her modifier is +2. Her hit point maximum at level one is 14.

## 8. Equipment
Every class has a list of equipment that they can take for free at level one. This includes weapons, armor and adventuring gear. This list can be found at the top of each class's page.

>As a Barbarian, Meera gets a martial weapon-she'll pick a battle axe-two hand axes, 4 javelins, and an explorer's pack.
