# Creating a Character
Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition has greatly simplified the character creation process from past editions. As such, it is easier than ever to roll up a new character in a matter of minutes! This guide will cover the basics of how to build a character using a sample character as an example. It will begin with a concept, and that concept will be transformed into a fully playable level one character.  

**NOTE:** The _only_ things you need to play Dungeons and Dragons are a pencil, some paper, and one set of polyhedral dice. There are many other things that players may like to use, to make the game more for them and their characters, but none of them are required to play, nor are they required for a good time. For convenience, there is a [character sheet](./5eCharacterSheetPrintVersion.pdf) attached to this repository.  
> The example character built here will appear in sections that look like this.

#### A Note on Dice
There are 7 polyhedral dice in a given set. They contain: 1 four-sided die, 1 six-sided die, 1 eight-sided, 2 ten-sided dice, 1 twelve-sided die, and twenty-sided die. From this point on, this reference will be using shorthand. When told to roll a number of dice it will look something like this: **2d10**. The first number is the number of dice to be rolled, the second number is the number of the sides the dice should have. **2d10** means roll two ten-sided dice. **4d6** means roll 4 six-sided dice.

#### So, grab some snacks, sharpen your pencil, and get your dice ready; get ready to build your character!

## 1. Concept
Come up with a concept. This sounds simple, but Dungeons and Dragons is a roleplaying game. You aren't usually just kicking in doors to kill monsters (although that _can_ be fun); you are a person with flaws and boons and quirks. This is meant to be a starting place. Come up with a name. Do you want your character to be loud and boisterous, or perhaps they should be quiet and contemplative. Do they care about other people, or do they only think about themselves and whatever makes them the most money.  

**NOTE:** Some people enjoy playing characters with qualities that are less familiar to them. Challenge yourself with something a bit outside of your comfort zone, but make sure that you take other peoples' experiences into account and that everyone is comfortable at the gaming table.

## 2. Assign Ability Scores
Every character has a number of attributes that determine their physical and mental capabilities. There are six such attributes: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha).
* **Strength** determines the physical prowess of your character. How much can you lift or carry? Can you kick down that door? Can you carry all of that gold out of the dungeon?
* **Dexterity** determines you ability to be nimble, fast and coordinated. Can you balance on the rickety bridge over lava? Can you hit a moving target with a rock? can you slide under the closing portcullis without being hurt?
* **Constitution** determines how hardy you are. Can you eat something poisonous and survive? Can you sprint up the mountain path without suffering from exhaustion? Can you survive being attacked by that dragon?
* **Intelligence** determines you aptitude for logic and memory. Can you remember the obscure lore about the evil magical artifact? Can you figure out which key is meant for the magical lock? Can you search for the hidden trap in a methodical way?
* **Wisdom** determines your attention and attunement to the world around you. Can you tell if that shopkeeper is lying? Do you see the hidden goblins waiting to ambush you on the road? Can you convince the terrified horse to calm down?
* **Charisma** determines your presence and force of personality. Can you intimidate the guards into leaving alone? Can you convince the shopkeeper to give you a discount on those potions? And exactly how energetic was your performance at the local inn?

To determine your ability scores, you need a set of 6 numbers. The simplest way to generate these is to use what the rules call the **"Standard Array:"** 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8; however, the most popular way to generate ability scores is to roll for them.
