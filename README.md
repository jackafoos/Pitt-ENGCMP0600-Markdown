# Creating a Character
Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition has greatly simplified the character creation process from past editions. As such, it is easier than ever to roll up a new character in a matter of minutes! This guide will cover the basics of how to build a character using a sample character as an example. It will begin with a concept, and that concept will be transformed into a fully playable level one character.  

**NOTE:** The _only_ things you need to play Dungeons and Dragons are a pencil, some paper, and one set of polyhedral dice. There are many other things that players may like to use, to make the game more for them and their characters, but none of them are required to play, nor are they required for a good time. For convenience, there is a [character sheet](./5eCharacterSheetPrintVersion.pdf) attached to this repository.  
> The example character built here will appear in sections that look like this.

**A Note on Dice**  
There are 7 polyhedral dice in a given set. They contain: 1 four-sided die, 1 six-sided die, 1 eight-sided, 2 ten-sided dice, 1 twelve-sided die, and twenty-sided die. From this point on, this reference will be using shorthand. When told to roll a number of dice it will look something like this: **2d10**. The first number is the number of dice to be rolled, the second number is the number of the sides the dice should have. **2d10** means roll two ten-sided dice. **4d6** means roll 4 six-sided dice.

#### So, grab some snacks, sharpen your pencil, and get your dice ready; get ready to build your character!

## 1. Concept
Come up with a concept. This sounds simple, but Dungeons and Dragons is a roleplaying game. You aren't usually just kicking in doors to kill monsters (although that _can_ be fun); you are a person with flaws and boons and quirks. This is meant to be a starting place. Come up with a name. Do you want your character to be loud and boisterous, or perhaps they should be quiet and contemplative. Do they care about other people, or do they only think about themselves and whatever makes them the most money.  

**NOTE:** Some people enjoy playing characters with qualities that are less familiar to them. Challenge yourself with something a bit outside of your comfort zone, but make sure that you take other peoples' experiences into account and that everyone is comfortable at the gaming table.
> Meera has always hated when people underestimate her. She may be short but she fights with the ferocity of 100 well trained soldiers. In her spare time, she likes to help people out with their problems. She has temper issues, especially when anyone questions their capabilities or strength.

## 2. Assign Ability Scores
Every character has a number of attributes that determine their physical and mental capabilities. There are six such attributes: Strength (Str), Dexterity (Dex), Constitution (Con), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha).
* **Strength** determines the physical prowess of your character. How much can you lift or carry? Can you kick down that door? Can you carry all of that gold out of the dungeon?
* **Dexterity** determines you ability to be nimble, fast and coordinated. Can you balance on the rickety bridge over lava? Can you hit a moving target with a rock? can you slide under the closing portcullis without being hurt?
* **Constitution** determines how hardy you are. Can you eat something poisonous and survive? Can you sprint up the mountain path without suffering from exhaustion? Can you survive being attacked by that dragon?
* **Intelligence** determines you aptitude for logic and memory. Can you remember the obscure lore about the evil magical artifact? Can you figure out which key is meant for the magical lock? Can you search for the hidden trap in a methodical way?
* **Wisdom** determines your attention and attunement to the world around you. Can you tell if that shopkeeper is lying? Do you see the hidden goblins waiting to ambush you on the road? Can you convince the terrified horse to calm down?
* **Charisma** determines your presence and force of personality. Can you intimidate the guards into leaving alone? Can you convince the shopkeeper to give you a discount on those potions? And exactly how energetic was your performance at the local inn?

To determine your ability scores, you need a set of 6 numbers. The simplest way to generate these is to use what the rules call the **"Standard Array:"** 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8; however, the most popular way to generate ability scores is to roll for them.

1. Roll 4d6.
1. Drop the lowest of the 4 dice.
1. Add up the remaining 3 dice and write the number down.
1. Repeat steps 1 - 4 until you have 6 number written down.

Once you have six scores, place them as you wish among your different abilities. Every class has key abilities that determine how effective their features are. Place your highest scores in those abilities.  

**A Note on Low Scores:** Sometimes you have low ability scores. Embrace it! having flaws baked into your character can be lots of fun. It adds to the randomness at the gaming table and often leads to the most memorable moments in a game.
> Meera's player rolled for ability scores and got 17, 14, 14, 12, 9, and 6. Meera is very strong and hardy so she'll put a 17 in Strength and a 14 in Constitution. She pretty coordinated in a tense moment so she'll put another 14 in Dexterity. She grew up around intelligent people who were able to coach and tutor her, despite her modest upbringing so she'll put a 12 in intelligence. She may not be the best at sweet talking people but she has a strong presence so she'll put a 9 in Charisma. Lastly, Meera tends to be impulsive and often acts without thinking or observing the situation. She'll put her  in wisdom.

## 3. Pick a Race
There are a number of different races in Dungeons and Dragons. This determines things like your general appearance, heritage, age, height, and more. Each race comes with a few ability score bonuses, languages and other features. Some races even have a sub-race which determines even more features and abilities. For a full list of features that your race gets visit the link in the following table.

Race | Ability Score Increases | Has Sub-Race
---- | ----------------------- | -----------
[Human](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/human/) | +1 to all ability scores | No
[Dwarf](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/dwarf/) | +2 Con | Yes
[Elf](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/elf/) | +2 Dex | Yes
[Halfling](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/halfling/) | +2 Dex | Yes
[Gnome](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/gnome/) | +2 Int | Yes
[Half-Elf](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/half-elf/) | +2 Charisma, +1 to two others | No
[Dragonborn](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/dragonborn/) | +2 Str, +1 Cha | No
[Half-Orc](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/half-orc/) | +2 Str, +1 Con | No
[Tiefling](https://5thsrd.org/character/races/tiefling/) | +2 Cha, +1 Int | No

> Meera wants to play a small character so she'll play a Halfling (Sub-race: lightfoot). This allows her to increase her Dexterity Score by two and her charisma by 1. Additionally, she gets a number of other features as determined by the Halfling link above.
