# Creating a Character
Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition has greatly simplified the character creation process from past editions. As such, it is easier than ever to roll up a new character in a matter of minutes! This guide will cover the basics of how to build a character using a sample character as an example. It will begin with a concept, and that concept will be transformed into a fully playable level one character.  

**NOTE:** The _only_ things you need to play Dungeons and Dragons are a pencil, some paper, and one set of polyhedral dice. There are many other things that players may like to use, to make the game more for them and their characters, but none of them are required to play, nor are they required for a good time. For convenience, there is a [character sheet](./5eCharacterSheetPrintVersion.pdf) attached to this repository.  
> The example character built here will appear in sections that look like this.

So, grab some snacks, sharpen your pencil, and get your dice ready; get ready to build your character!
